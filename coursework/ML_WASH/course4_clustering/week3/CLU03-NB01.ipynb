Does this mean we should always favor a higher K? **Not at all!** As we will see in the following section, setting K too high may end up separating data points that are actually pretty alike. At the extreme, we can set individual data points to be their own clusters (K=N) and achieve zero heterogeneity, but separating each data point into its own cluster is hardly a desirable outcome. In the following section, we will learn how to detect a K set \"too large\"."

    "Another heuristic people use that does not rely on so much visualization, which can be hard in many applications (including here!) is as follows.  Track heterogeneity versus K and look for the \"elbow\" of the curve where the heterogeneity decrease rapidly before this value of K, but then only gradually for larger values of K.  This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity.  In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is \"reasonable\" and we only see real overfitting for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)"
